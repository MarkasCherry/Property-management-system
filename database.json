Just upstream from (west of) the Togetsu-kyo Bridge, which marks the center of the area, and situated alongside the murmurs of the Oi River, is Arashiyama Benkei. Our ryokan accommodations, built in the traditional sukiya-zukuri architecture style reminiscent of antique tea houses, is not simply a place to rest and eat, but also houses facilities in which guests can enjoy Arashiyama onsen (hot springs) and indulge in traditional Kyoto cuisine. Please visit us to experience the utmost in comfort and relaxation. -Rooms- Arashiyama Benkei is honored to provide 10 guest rooms, each with their own individual charm. Each room is thoughtfully designed and furnished in the Japanese style, featuring views of the Arashiyama mountains or our lush garden. Cherry blossoms in spring, cormorant fishing in summer, cascading colors of maple leaves in autumn, and a dusting of snow in winter. Our guests are certain to enjoy a peaceful stay among the beauty and stillness of this unique Kyoto scenery. -Onsen- Arashiyama onsen (hot spring) water has a pH of 8.3 and provides an exceptionally smooth touch that is said to beautify skin and wash away any travel fatigue. Benkei has indoor and open-air baths; both are available for men and women and are separated by gender. Guests who prefer to enjoy a bath in private may reserve a secluded open-air bathtub (same-day reservation, \\2,160/group/45 minutes). -Cuisine- Guests at Benkei indulge in traditional multi-course kaiseki fare that uses seasonal ingredients found not only in Kyoto, but sourced from all over Japan. We take care in creating cuisine that appeals to all palates, yet maintains respect for the tenets of traditional Kyoto cooking. -Day Trips- Day trip guests at Benkei may also opt to enjoy a relaxing bath in addition to a gourmet meal. Reservations are required for combined onsen and dining day trips. The facilities open at 11:30 a.m. We offer full plans that include meals in private room (2 hours for bento meals or 3 hours for full-course kaiseki meals), baths, towels, and yukata robe, as well as more informal plans that include a restaurant meal in the open space and onsen bath.\n",
